## 1. Project's goals:
  
* Preserving the environment - increasing awareness of maintaining a clean environment
* Resources saving
* Providing extensive knowledge of various options for preserving the environment such as: recycling, saving electricity, measured consumption of water, etc.
* Integrating the project idea into everyday life
* The player becomes a person who cares more about the environment
* The player will enjoy the game as he learns to preserve the environment


</br>


## 2. The characteristics and requirements of the game will be divided into "necessary" and those we would like to add later:

| Serial Number | Player's POV | Developer's POV | category | Remarks
--- | --- | --- |--- | ---
| 1 | The player learns how to preserve the environment | The player progresses in stages as he enjoys and learns about the various cycle options | necessary | The player becomes a person who cares more about his personal environment as well as the general environment  |
| 2 | The player learns how to save resources | The player progresses in stages as he enjoys and learns about the various cycle options | necessary | The resources can be water, electricity, gas, fuel, etc. |
| 3 | The player wants to enjoy playing the game | Like any app developer, we want the user to enjoy the game and not get bored up to the point of removing the game from his PC. | necessary | The player enjoys while learning |
| 4 | Changing the appearance of the player character | In order not to get bored from the same character, it will be possible to change the character's settings - hair color for example or even changing the player's name  | less necessary | Adding hair color that is unnatural for example blue or red Adding an option for a "special" name using characters - ö, ß and more.  |
| 5 | Varied and diverse levels | The developer wants the player to learn a variety of things | less necessary | By saying "variety" the intention is to teach the player how to recycle correctly objects he finds on the sidewalk, or even in his own house. Then when the player moves on to the next stage there will be a study on what can be done through recycling plastic cups or glass bottles and more. This point of view will be necessary later on mainly to prevent the active players from stopping playing |

</br>

## 3.	Possible obstacles we encounter in weekly progress:
  
* Schedule
*	Manpower that will allow the developers to meet all the requirements in a high way, until implementation in the game
*	Serious lack of time and PlayTest bugs - may crash the game or cause unwanted functionality



</br>

## 4.	Marketing the game as a commercial advertisement (worded as both male and female):

* The conduct of human beings on a daily basis has been polluting the environment and the air. </br> 
  The world is becoming a sullied place to live. </br> 
Let's fix the world! </br>
This is a game where you can make the world better, greener and cleaner 💚

</br>

## 5.	Concise document:

The game is appointed for any child who is able to play on a computer (age 6 and up). </br>
Fantastic World differs from other games in that it combines both learning to preserve the environment and saving basic things that the person does on a daily basis, thus making the personal and general environment greener. </br>
The game is varied and challenging for the player, and from its simplicity it will be possible to finish all stages of the game while it is relatively short. The user's opinion will get other people interested in the game and buy it for themselves. </br>
At the beginning of the game the user sees the "world" and the various stages. </br>
Each stage deals with a different field related to environmental protection. </br>
The next levels will be locked until the player successfully passes the previous levels. </br>

## 6. Market survey:

* <b> The Recycling Race (in hebrew מירוץ המיחזור):  </b> </br>

The Recycling Race is an environmental game for children, built in the form of the game "Ladders and Ropes". </br> 
Roll the dice and race against the problems of waste and environmental pollution. </br>
And how do you do that? Progress according to the number you received from the cube, answer the questions along the way and perform the environmental tasks. </br>

For example: What can be reused, what item is suitable for reduction, what can be recycled and what can be repaired? Have you reached the ladder? go upstairs. Did you land on a rope slot? Surf down ... Have you reached the end? excellent!</br>
You are really helping the environment😀

Resemblance: The game is similar in that it is important to learn about making the world a better place </br>

Difference: But the game is different because each time there are trivia questions that require a broad general knowledge </br>
In addition, the game is not so clear when trying to play it. </br>

<b> Fantastic World </b> </br>
Unlike this game, our game is three-dimensional having a detailed explanation of how to play.  </br>
The game will include various stages to teach the player to make the world a better place.  </br>
The game is different in terms of graphics operation.  </br>
Unlike their game (Recycling Race) which starts to be boring quickly,
Our game gives the player a feel for reality and gives him good feelings that will make him stay in the game. </br>


* <b>  Catomolo (in hebrew כתומולו):  </b>

Tamir's packaging cycle game. </br>
An innovative and fun way to learn about separating recyclable packaging in the orange bin and at the same time to test your instincts in an educational game for all ages. </br>

Catomolo is for children, and also for those who are looking for a game to improve concentration and learning. </br>

Try to sort the packaging as quickly as possible, decide what goes into the orange bin and what isn't, in order to pass stages and accumulate as many points as possible. </br>

You have to lower the right packages into the bin.</br>
As for the wrong packages you have to throw them to one of the sides so that they do not go into the orange bin. </br> 

All with the help of Tamir's cat Dedi. </br>
The one that always sits on the orange bin and reminding you that packages are thrown in the orange bin. </br>

Resemblance: The game teaches the player to preserve the environment </br>

There is a problem with their game: when we played Catomolo things related to the orange bin according to the rules of the game suddenly do not belong to the orange bin. </br>
So it's not really clear what's going on in the game. </br>

Differences: "Fantastic World" teaches not only about recycling but focuses on making the world better also in terms of saving electricity, water, gas, etc. </br>
The gameplay in Fantastic World in operations and graphics is different. </br> 

* <b>  Recycle Roundup (in hebrew ריסייקל ראונדאפ):  </b>

Help clean up the park! Your job is to sort the things that people throw away and put them in the appropriate bin. </br>
Is it recycling, compost or garbage? Get facts about climate change and tips on how you can help save the planet. </br>

Resemblance: The recycling phase is based on the same idea of separating the products into containers. </br>

Difference: "Fantastic World" is not only based on recycling but on many other things such as saving electricity, water, etc. </br>


* There are many more trivia games of different versions of cycle games mostly for kids but still not like our game </br>
